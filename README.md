This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

    Flutter Contacts App
</h1>

This small project is a Contact List made with Flutter and it has the objective to demonstrate how to apply the following features:

- Navigation between two screens sending parameters between them.
- Save contacts in Sqlite database.
- Create a list of cards with context menu for each one of them.
- Create a Dialog to inform users the they will lost changes if they don't save them.

This application is divided in two pages and a helper file with the database operations. The logic is mixed within the pages but since it is just for test purposes it is ok for now. In a near future I will structure the components in a better way.
